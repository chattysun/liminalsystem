1. Lead Capture Interface Mockup (Mid Page)

Concept: A clean, high-fidelity UI mockup of the Liminal questionnaire in action — showing friendly, step-by-step questions like "What's your credit score?" with visual cues (e.g., sliders, buttons, progress indicators).

How It Fits:

Placed next to the “Instant Pre-Qualification” section, this image builds trust by giving users a glimpse of the polished UX they and their clients will experience.

2. Conversion Rate Growth Chart (Next to Results Section)

Concept: A stylized graph showing a rising line labeled “+35% Qualified Leads” and “+28% Conversions” with visual tags like “Before Liminal” and “After Liminal.”

How It Fits:

Placed beside the “Boost Conversion Rates” section to visually anchor the data and make it instantly digestible. Clean, modern infographics work well here.

3. CRM Dashboard Integration Illustration (CRM Section)

Concept: A split-screen illustration. On one side, a Liminal lead funnel; on the other, icons representing CRMs (Floify, LendingPad, etc.) receiving enriched lead cards.

How It Fits:
Used in the “Powerful CRM Integration” section. Shows the value of centralized lead management and seamless tech stack compatibility in a visual, metaphorical way.

4. Website Transformation Before/After (Design Services Section)

Concept: Side-by-side mockups: one outdated mortgage site (gray, boxy, dated fonts) vs. one redesigned with modern fonts, a Liminal form embedded, and bright accent colors.

How It Fits:
Placed in the “Complete Website Redesign Available” section. Drives home the point that Liminal can both power and polish the broker’s digital presence.
